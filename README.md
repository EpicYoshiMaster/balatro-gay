# Balatro Gay Translations

This is very silly.

Changes a "Straight" into a "Gay".
Right now only in the english language, because i doubt this joke would make sense in other languages lol

I very much just looked what the people over at [FrBmt-BIGetNouf/balatro-french-translations](https://github.com/FrBmt-BIGetNouf/balatro-french-translations/) were doing, so check out their repo if you want better french translations or can contribute!

> **Disclaimer:** I don't know how up to date i can keep this, but i'll try

## How do I install the new file?
[7zip](https://7-zip.org/) must be installed on your computer.

1. **Close Balatro**
2. Download the en-us.lua
3. Go to the Balatro folder (Eg: `SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Balatro\`)
4. Right click on `Balatro.exe`
5. In the `7-Zip` menu, click on `Open archive`
6. Inside 7zip, open the `localization` folder
7. Drag'n'drop the downloaded file inside
8. Confirm the file copying and close 7zip
9. You can now launch Balatro, select the French language and enjoy!

> **Important:** The file update must be done every new game update.
